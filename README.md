## Design Methodology

When designing this skill, my aims were to take pressure off early game gold, while also providing a late game gold siphon. This makes it an attractive early game skill for adventure mode, and late game, especially once Township is up and running, the buffs are designed to be powerful enough that spending the gold is deemed worth it. By limiting to only a couple of bards, the player will need to spend their masses of gold to get the bonuses for the skills they are training.

## Change Log

### 1.4.0
* reduced tips (GP) scaling from mastery level from +15 GP each level to +10 GP each level, base instrument GP is no longer the same across all instruments, higher level instruments have a higher base GP than lower level instruments. This should hopefully make higher instruments feel a little better, this does result in less GP from lower instruments than the previous version.
* added three more instruments; the accordion, bouzouki and xylophone
* modified some instrument unlock levels and bonuses
  * drum - Unlock Level 15 -> Level 10
  * banjo - Unlock Level 30 -> Level 20
  * saxophone - Unlock Level 45 -> Level 70, now focused on defensive modifiers only
  * maraca - Unlock Level 60 -> Level 50
  * violin - Unlock Level 75 -> Level 80
  * bongo - now focused entirely on slayer, agility has been moved to xylophone
  * french horn - switched level 1 and 40 modifier bonuses
  * tambourine - increased level 1 farming yield % from 5 to 10 and level 40 flat farming yield from 5 to 15
  * trumpet - now focused on damage dealing only
* added a new shop purchase which lets you hire two bards at once
* added a new item, sheet music which is dropped while training Music
* added a new item, essence of music, which is upgraded from sheet music
* added the ability to upgrade hired bard instruments which unlocks a 5th modifier

### 1.3.0
* added a potion to Herblore which increases GP obtained while training Music
* added a summoning tablet for the Music skill, the Bard
* added a Music Scroll of XP which can be purchased from the Township trader with Planks
* added a Music Outfit to the Township category of the shop, it functions the same all other skilling outfits

### 1.2.0

* updated description of mastery and mastery pool hire cost reduction to better align with skill capes (no functional change)
* updated exponential calculation to clamp mastery between level 1 and 99 instead of throwing an error if outside this range
* adjusted the level that instruments are available at
* adjusted the experience gained from training. The time it takes to level should be roughly equivalent to Astrology, assuming no interval increases, xp modifiers, etc and you train the highest level instrument available
* added 3 new instruments; the harp, tambourine and maraca

### 1.1.0

* fixed hire dialog allowing to hire without enough gold
* updated instrument icons

### 1.0.3

* fixed violin 99 mastery bonus to reduce prayer cost instead of increase it

### 1.0.2

* fixed music mastery token granting no experience

### 1.0.1

* fixed the spelling of saxophone
* removed mastery token, capes and pet from being required for completion log
* removed music from being required for max and superior max capes
* skill cape now also reduces bard hire cost by 5% and increased gold earned from music by 5%
* superiorÂ skill cape now also reduces bard hire cost by 10% and increased gold earned from music by 10%

### 1.0.0

* initial release

## Training

Music is a brand new skill which combines themes from Astrology, Thieving and Agility. It provides an easy way to obtain gold and powerful bonuses that benefit other skills.

Earn tips (GP) while you train bards with various instruments, then hire the bards you have trained to provide you with powerful bonuses while you train other skills.

This mod includes a new mastery token for the skill and both skill cape and superior skill cape.

### Drops

While training you have a chance to obtain Signet Ring Half A, Circlet of Rhaelyx and Mysterious Stones, just like any other non combat skill.

Tips (GP) earned while training do scale with global gold increases.

### Sheet Music and Essence of Music

Training Music has a 1/100 chance to drop sheet music, these can be upgraded into Essence of Music for 50 Sheet Music + 1M GP.

![Items](images/items.png)

![Upgrade](images/essence-of-music-upgrade.png)

1 Essence of Music is used to upgrade Hired Bard instruments, which unlocks a 5th modifier.

Upgrades are destroyed if you hire a new bard. Re-hiring a previously hired bard will require using another Essence of Music to unlock the upgrade modifier.

![Upgrade](images/upgrade-bard-instrument.png)

## Hiring a Bard

You can hire various bards to play on your behalf. These bards provide powerful bonuses to help you while you train other skills, however the more skilled a bard is, the more expensive it will become to hire them.

You can only hire a single bard at a time (two if you purchase the Band Practice upgrade).

The cost of hiring a bard grows exponentially more expensive per mastery level.

![Hire a Bard](images/hire-bard.png)

## Band Practice

The shop sells an upgrade which unlocks a second bard slot. This upgrade requires Level 110 Music and costs 1B GP.

![Band Practice](images/band-practice.png)

![Double Bard](images/double-bard.png)

## Skill Unlocks

Leveling the Music skill unlocks additional musical instruments to train your bards with.

![Skill Unlocks](images/instrument-unlocks.png)

## Mastery Pool Unlocks

Mastery Pool checkpoints provide additional xp, mastery xp, music interval and hire cost reduction.

![Mastery Pool Unlocks](images/mastery-pool-unlocks.png)

## Mastery Unlocks

As you level up an instruments mastery, the tips you earn increases, but the cost to hire the bard for that instrument also increases. You also unlock additional bonuses and reduce the hire cost.

![Mastery Unlocks](images/mastery-unlocks.png)

## Skill Capes

The Music Skill Cape

![Music Skillcape](images/music-skillcape.png)

The Superior Music Skill Cape

![Superior Music Skillcape](images/superior-music-skillcape.png)

## Pet

The Music skill also contains a pet: Muse which provides -1% Music Interval

![Muse](images/muse-pet.png)

## Herblore

The Generous Gratuity Potion can be brewed using the Herblore skill.

![Potion](images/potion.png)

* Herblore Unlock Level: 80
* Materials: 1 Pigtayle Herb + 1,000 GP
* Tier 1: +10% Music GP, 15 Charges
* Tier 2: +20% Music GP, 25 Charges
* Tier 3: +30% Music GP, 35 Charges
* Tier 4: +50% Music GP, 50 Charges

The potion has also been added to Potion Box II from Township, at the same rarity as the Herblore Potion.

![Potion Box](images/potion-box.png)

## Summoning

The Music skill has its own tablet. The Bard! The Bard is both a combat and skill tablet.

![Bard Tablet](images/bard-tablet.png)

![Bard Mark](images/bard-mark.png)

* Tier: 3
* Summoning Level Requirement: 90
* Summoning Max Hit: 192
* Skill Bonus: +5% Music GP

In addition, the Bard has synergies with every single other tablet. Since Music is a skill that focuses on boosting other skills, its synergy helps all other skills. It basically doubles the tablet effect of the tablet it is synergizing with (by granting the same tablet modifiers via the synergy).

Example: Devil gives -5% Firemaking Interval, if synergized with the Bard, the synergy will provide an addition -5% Firemaking Interval for a total of -10% Firemaking Interval being provided from the tablets.

The Fox synergy actually works in reverse, kind of... the Bard synergy doubles the Fox tablet modifier, which then boosts the Bards Summoning max hit.

![Summoning](images/summoning-1.png)

![Summoning](images/summoning-2.png)

## Township

The Music skill adds a Music Scroll of XP granting +3% Music Skill XP. It functions the same as other scrolls of xp.

It requires level 15 Township and level 15 Music to purchase, with a default value of 80 planks per scroll.

![Township](images/township-xp-scroll.png)

The Music skill adds a Music Outfit, which is fully integrated just like all the other skilling outfits.
